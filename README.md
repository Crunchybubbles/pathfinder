# pathfinder

This is the continuation of me learning about dex arbitrage and rust.
This project initially was exploring path finding through a graph. At this point I was having a better idea about how peices could fit together 
to build dex arbitrage software. I have learned a lot since starting my initial learning_arb project and still have much more to learn. 
This is the project I am currently working on and have been having a lot of fun with it. Most recently I have started learning about concurrency and 
find it to be an exteremely interesting new way of thinking about programming.
